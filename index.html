		<p>Waves are constantly rolling in, even when the tide goes out, the waves keep on coming. If we think of waves as the troubles in our life, it shows us that troubles will keep coming. There is no life without striving to stand up. We can let those waves knock us down and keep us out of the ocean in the same way we can let our troubles defeat us. However, each time we face a wave we learn how to better face the next one. We learn to turn into it a bit differently, or to jump over it, or swim under it. There is no avoiding a wave, but there are ways of dealing with it. Bad times are always coming, but each time we go through one we can learn how to minimize the impact of the next one. We can also learn to avoid some in the future.</p>

		<p>I love the beach. Having gone through some troubling times of my own, I have determined to live life as if the waves are both good and bad, but that they can be used for learning and for fun just the same. If life is like a beach, then it is warm and beautiful. If it is like an ocean wave, then it is fun and full of energy. Live your life like an ocean wave on the beach.</p>
